# G2ClassicRevived
Gothic II Classic reimagined with Night of the Raven content, without it's lore!
This sentence is a lie, however. As there's a lot more changes going on in the mod. Major part remains, however: there is no Jharkendar plot, no Water Mages and no stone tablets.

Eventually, when Classic Revived would be finished, I plan to bring back Night of the Raven plot but reimagined as well.
